# What is Preview Alexa Client?

Now the SDK ships with two application executables: Sample App and Preview Alexa Client.

This is intended to ease the transition to using the manufactory, which requires significant work performed incrementally over the next few releases.

**Preview Alexa Client** is a sneak peek into the ongoing work to integrating the manufactory into the SDK, and you should expect its `PreviewAlexaClientComponent` and related manufactory objects to change substantially over the next several releases while the work is completed. We will not maintain backwards-compatibility for the Preview Alexa Client during this time. We encourage you to take a look to familiarize yourself with these new concepts.

Preview Alexa Client is functionally the same as the Sample App, but its source code is quite different.
